# Single-Price-Grid
Challenge1 - SinglePriceGrid HTML

This was my very first challenge as a new student. This was done using basic HTML, CSS and CSS Grid knowledge. I used a CSS button generator to design and generate the code for the button. In the preview prior to posting to VS Code, the text was displayed, however when adding the code to my styles2.css, it does not. Not sure what happened. Also, was not sure what to do with the custom mobile and desktop specs data. Other than that, I am extremely proud of my first attempt. Will continue working on it to properly finish all the tasks asked.
